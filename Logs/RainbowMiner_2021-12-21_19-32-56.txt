*** RainbowMiner Configuration ***


Hints (read them all! It will make entering data much easier):

- press Return to accept the defaults
- fields marked with * are mandatory
- use comma "," to separate list entries
- add new entries to a list, by adding a "+" in front of your input
- remove entries from a list, by adding a "-" in front of your input
- enter "list" or "help" to show a list of all valid entries
- enter "back" or "<" to repeat the last input
- enter "delete" to clear a non-mandatory entry
- enter "save" or "done" to end config and save changes
- enter "exit" or "cancel" to abort without any changes to the configuration


(1) Basic Setup


Every pool (except the MiningPoolHub) wants the miner to send a worker's name. You can change the name later. Please enter only letters and numbers.


Let's start with the local setup of this machine's API.

RainbowMiner can be monitored using your webbrowser via API:
- on this machine: http://localhost:4000
- on most devices in the network: http://DA1712:4000
- on any other device in the network: http://192.168.1.6:4000


Now let us continue with your server's credentials


Server connected successfully!


It is possible to let the server rig control pools/coins/balance data of the client.
This reduces network traffic significantly. The local pool setup will be ignored.
MiningRigRentals is exluded - this pool always runs locally.


RainbowMiner can use centralized configuration files:
selected config files will be downloaded automatically, if changed on the server rig

HINT:
If specific config files for this client are needed, put them into subdirectory ".\Config\da1712inti7" on your server
Clients can be grouped together for shared config files. You will be asked for a group, if you enable now.
